# JavaCpp-OpenCv-Linux-Arm

This Will finally hold the whole javacpp-codebase modified for Linux-Arm platform. 

For now it just holds the OpenCV build file.

Need to clone the Javacpp-presets from this link 

https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets

and replace the cppbuild.sh from the file from this Repo and intitate a build using this command

./cppbuild.sh install
